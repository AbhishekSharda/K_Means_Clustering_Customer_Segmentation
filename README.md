# K_Means_Clustering_Customer_Segmentation

Project Description:

In this project, I have performed customer segmentation using K-means clustering. The goal of this project is to understand the characteristics of different customer groups and create targeted marketing strategies to improve business performance.

Steps Performed:

Importing Libraries: I have imported required libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn to perform data analysis.

Loading Data: I loaded the dataset into my notebook using pandas.

Data Cleaning: I checked for missing values and duplicates in the dataset and performed data cleaning operations to prepare the dataset for analysis.

Data Preprocessing: I transformed categorical data into numerical data using one-hot encoding, and standardized numerical data using StandardScaler.

Dimensionality Reduction: I performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features in the dataset.

Clustering: I used K-means clustering algorithm to cluster customers into different groups based on their characteristics.

Evaluating Models: I used the elbow method and silhouette score to evaluate the performance of the K-means clustering algorithm.

Profiling: I analyzed the characteristics of different customer segments and created customer personas to understand their preferences and behaviors.

Conclusion: Based on the insights gained from the customer segmentation analysis, I made recommendations to improve business performance and increase customer satisfaction.

Overall, this project demonstrates how data analysis techniques can be used to gain insights into customer behavior and improve business performance.

# About this file
Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.
Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments.
